## Running Tests

### Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Unit tests (existing database/server tests)
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# End-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# Performance tests
npm run test:performance

# Load tests
npm run test:load

# All tests
npm run test:all
```

### Comprehensive Test Runner

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite with reporting
npx tsx src/__tests__/run-comprehensive-tests.ts
```

The comprehensive runner:
- Runs all test suites in order
- Generates detailed performance reports
- Provides recommendations for improvements
- Saves results to `test-reports/` directory

### Test Configuration

Tests adapt to different environments:

- **Development**: Reduced load, faster timeouts
- **CI**: Balanced performance, cleanup enabled
- **Production**: Full load testing, comprehensive reporting

Set environment with:
```bash
TEST_ENV=ci npm run test:all
```

## Performance Requirements Validation

- ✅ Script searches with text indexing (< 3s search operations)

### Requirement 4.2: Concurrent User Support
- ✅ Concurrent user operations (20 concurrent < 8s)
- ✅ Data consistency under concurrent access
- ✅ Proper schema design validation

### Requirement 4.4: System Reliability

- ✅ Data integrity validation
- ✅ Resource usage monitoring

## Test Coverage

The comprehensive test suite provides:

## Reporting

Test results include:

- **Summary Statistics**: Pass/fail rates, duration, performance metrics
- **Performance Analysis**: Slowest tests, memory usage, recommendations
- **Failure Analysis**: Detailed error information and debugging data
- **Trend Analysis**: Performance trends over time (when run repeatedly)

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Follow existing patterns in the appropriate test category
2. Use provided utilities for setup and assertions
3. Add performance thresholds to configuration
4. Update this README with new test descriptions

### Performance Tuning

1. Monitor test reports for performance degradation
2. Adjust thresholds in `test-suite.config.ts` as needed
3. Use performance utilities to identify bottlenecks
4. Consider test environment differences

### CI Integration

The test suite is designed for CI/CD integration:
- Environment-specific configurations
- Proper cleanup and resource management
- Detailed reporting for build systems
- Exit codes for pass/fail determination

## Dependencies

The test suite uses:
