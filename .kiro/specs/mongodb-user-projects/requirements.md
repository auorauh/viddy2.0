# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a MongoDB database structure to support user authentication and project management for the video content creation application. Users will be able to create accounts, manage their profile information, and organize their video scripts into nested project structures with hierarchical folder organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to create and manage my user account, so that I can securely access my personal video projects and scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL create a user document with unique identifier, email, username, and profile information
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate against stored credentials and return user session data
3. IF a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL validate and persist the changes to the user document
4. WHEN a user is created THEN the system SHALL automatically create a default "My Projects" folder for organizing scripts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to organize my video scripts into projects and folders, so that I can efficiently manage different content series and campaigns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a project THEN the system SHALL store project metadata including title, description, creation date, and owner reference
2. WHEN a user creates a folder within a project THEN the system SHALL support nested folder structures with parent-child relationships
3. IF a user moves a script between folders THEN the system SHALL update the script's folder reference while maintaining data integrity
4. WHEN a user deletes a project THEN the system SHALL cascade delete all associated folders and scripts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to store my video scripts with rich metadata, so that I can track script versions, content type, and production status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a script THEN the system SHALL store script content, title, metadata, and associate it with a project and folder
2. WHEN a script is updated THEN the system SHALL update the modification timestamp and maintain version history
3. IF a user searches for scripts THEN the system SHALL support text search across script titles and content
4. WHEN scripts are retrieved THEN the system SHALL include populated project and folder information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want my data to be efficiently organized and queryable, so that I can quickly access my projects and scripts without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is queried THEN the system SHALL use appropriate indexes for user lookups, project queries, and script searches
2. WHEN retrieving user projects THEN the system SHALL efficiently populate nested folder structures and script counts
3. IF concurrent users access the system THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency through proper schema design
4. WHEN performing aggregation queries THEN the system SHALL optimize for common access patterns like "user's recent scripts" and "project statistics"
